Web application to manage decalcify tissue in a pathology

### Introduction
Decalcification of tissue in pathology is a crucial process used to remove calcium deposits from mineralized tissues, such as bone and teeth, to facilitate microscopic examination. This procedure involves immersing the tissue in a decalcifying solution—commonly acids like nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, or chelating agents such as EDTA—that dissolves the calcium salts without compromising the tissue's cellular structures. Proper decalcification ensures that tissues can be sectioned thinly and stained effectively, allowing pathologists to accurately diagnose conditions involving calcified tissues, including tumors, infections, or metabolic disorders.
