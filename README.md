### Introduction
Decalcification of tissue in pathology is a crucial process used to remove calcium deposits from mineralized tissues, such as bone and teeth, to facilitate microscopic examination. This procedure involves immersing the tissue in a decalcifying solution—commonly acids like nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, or chelating agents such as EDTA—that dissolves the calcium salts without compromising the tissue's cellular structures. Proper decalcification ensures that tissues can be sectioned thinly and stained effectively, allowing pathologists to accurately diagnose conditions involving calcified tissues, including tumors, infections, or metabolic disorders.

### Web Application
To handle tissues and the decalcification process, I created a responsive online application with different roles. MTAs can examine tissues, and pathologists can produce new ones. In a sqlite database, everything is protocolized. At last, laboratory personnel can examine every tissue and look for certain ones.
